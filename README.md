# Dash Runner 

A real-time 2D game prototype built from scratch in C++ using SFML. Features smooth player motion, wall collisions, enemy patrols, collectible scoring, and a game state manager.

## Features

- Real-time physics-based player movement with acceleration and friction
- Predictive collision system using SFML's `FloatRect`
- AI-controlled enemy with patrol behavior
- Score tracking and collectible item system
- Game Over / Restart state flow using keyboard input
- Clean object-oriented C++ design (modular classes for player, wall, enemy, collectible)

## Build Instructions
